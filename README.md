# Dynamic-AI-Chatbot
Conversational AI Chatbot using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Generative AI (GenAI)
This project implements a conversational AI chatbot that uses NLP techniques to understand user input prompts and generate human-like responses using a language model. The chatbot is built using a custom ConversationManager class that leverages the Together API for language modeling.

Key features:

Natural Language Processing (NLP): Implements language modeling for text generation
Generative AI (GenAI): Uses generative models to produce human-like text responses
Conversational AI: Enables users to interact with the chatbot using natural language input
Language Understanding: Parses user input prompts to generate relevant responses
Response Generation: Uses a language model to generate human-like text responses
This project demonstrates the application of NLP and GenAI techniques to build a conversational AI system that can understand and respond to user input. The code is written in Python and is available for reference and modification.

Feel free to modify it to fit your specific project and needs!

I have leveraged Together API for Language Modeling . If you're getting your API key from OpenAI or anyother platform , Please go through their updated API documentation and modify this code to your needs ! 

Thanks for visiting :)
